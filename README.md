## Purpose

We are developing a software application for WSU Inc., a wholesale food distribution company, to help them meet their business needs to become more efficient and profitable. Our project follows the SCRUM framework, consisting of two sprints, each taking roughly three to four weeks.

## Table of Contents
In [Sprint 1](https://git.wayne.edu/gt2533/group2/-/tree/master#sprint-1-functionalities), we focused on developing log in/log out functionalities, accepting user inputs from a variety of users, and storing the users' information. To complete this, we implemented the following four features:
- [Feature 1: Login and Logout](https://git.wayne.edu/gt2533/group2/-/tree/master#feature-1-login-and-logout)
- [Feature 2: Customer Profiles](https://git.wayne.edu/gt2533/group2/-/tree/master#feature-2-customer-profiles)
- [Feature 3: Vendor Profiles](https://git.wayne.edu/gt2533/group2/-/tree/master#feature-3-vendor-profiles)
- [Feature 4: Item Profiles](https://git.wayne.edu/gt2533/group2/-/tree/master#feature-4-item-profiles)

In [Sprint 2](https://git.wayne.edu/gt2533/group2/-/tree/master#sprint-2-functionalities), we focused on developing purchasing and selling functionalities while adding extra functionalities and restrictions to the features from Sprint 1. To complete this, we implemented the following four features:

- [Feature 5: Purchase Order](https://git.wayne.edu/gt2533/group2/-/tree/master#feature-5-purchase-order)
- [Feature 6: Customer Order](https://git.wayne.edu/gt2533/group2/-/tree/master#feature-6-customer-order)
- [Feature 7: Customer Invoice](https://git.wayne.edu/gt2533/group2/-/tree/master#feature-7-customer-invoice)
- [Feature 8: Other Functions](https://git.wayne.edu/gt2533/group2/-/tree/master#feature-8-other-functions)
